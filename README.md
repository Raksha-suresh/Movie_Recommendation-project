A Python-powered movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on a user’s input. It uses TF-IDF vectorization, cosine similarity, and movie metadata (title, genres, descriptions) from the MovieLens dataset. The project includes a simple Flask web interface where users can type any movie title and instantly get top recommendations.
